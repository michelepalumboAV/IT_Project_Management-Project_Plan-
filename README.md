# IT_Project_Management-Project_Plan

The Italian economy is mainly based on tourism. In this regard, we have tried to enhance the most successful point, namely the artistic and cultural heritage, giving more attention to museums as a means of attracting tourists to discover our history, culture and tradition.
Day after day, the audience of cultural visitors has increased dramatically, attracting the attention of many companies in integrating computer technology with culture.
Our company, therefore, has thought to invest in this area by proposing a new product to the service of the museums to emphasize its works through augmented reality.
Augmented reality is taking away more and more foot, with the aim of enriching the experience of the user of an exhibition or of turning the streets into open-air museums.
When a visitor enters a museum, the AR can become the means to show the work in its context, provide important details to the user and allow the visualization of related works of art, creating real emotional paths.
The museum becomes, therefore, a real toy in scale 1:1 and the objects are no longer considered "relics" but assume a well-defined form thanks to their contextualization.
The target audience includes all age groups, involving both adults and children. And it is precisely in this area that augmented reality is proposed as a great help for the educational mission of the museums.
